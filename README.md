# A* Pathfinding algorithm

This program illustrates the A* pathfinding algorithm using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In the visualization, the red signifies the path already checked, the green signifies the path currently evaluating, and the black signifies obstacles where the path can't traverse. Each point in the grid has its own value and the algorithm optimizes by solely evaluating the minimum value.
